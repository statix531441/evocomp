Experiment 1:
Ran an evolutionary experiment 3 times, each with a different level of environmental unpredictability:

0.0	Fully static --- (never changes)
    converges fast
    enthropy drops sharp. 
0.05 --- Rare changes

0.1	Moderate, ---- occasional changes
    entropy remained moderate
    fitness stayed higher
    mutual information accumulated steadily

0.2 ---	Frequent changes
    entropy remained high
    mutual information was low/ noisy
    populations fluctuated in fitness.

0.5	Chaotic environment --- (very high unpredictability)
    same as 0.2. 
    When the environment changed too frequently: genomes could not converge on meaningful patterns. 

The only difference between runs was how often the environment changes. 
Answer to this experiment: complexity emerges strongest when the environment is neither too static nor too unpredictable.

Experiment 2:
tested mutation rate impact on fitness, entropy, mutual information, and gene stability. Ran an evolutionary experiment 3 times for mutation rate sweep.
i. Trying new gene combinations(for adaptation). 
ii. Refining known good solutions(for convergence).

0.001 --- very low mutation
    fitnes improves stable but slow 
    Strong convergence
    Entropy drops over time

0.1 --- moderate mutation
    Tracks environment changes well
    Fitness improved much faster than in 0.001
    Entropy stays higher

0.2 --- high mutation 
    fluctuation in fitness. 
    Entropy stays extremely high
    Too much randomness

Answer to this experiment: if the mutation rate is too low the population converges prematurely and explores very little. but if its too high population becomes chaotic and trouble learning. 
Moderate showed best balance of exploration and exploitation.
